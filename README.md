# A DECENTRALIZED SECURE ELECTION SYSTEM

Elections are used by humans to make decisions collaboratively since ancient times. With technology growing fast and integrating into almost all aspects of our lives, elections are also transformed onto electronic systems.  Security is an important topic when it comes to electronic voting (e-voting) because voters are trusting the system with their decisions. Transparency is the biggest problem with e-voting systems. In this thesis, we propose a decentralized secure election system, namely Decentralized Secure Election System (ADSES) that utilizes distributed immutable database architecture to store voting data transparently, albeit securely. ADSES limits the authority's power and uses blockchain that reflects all the operations on the system to increase the trust in the system.
